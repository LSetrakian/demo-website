The datasets MAPC 2008-2012 Aggregate Rent by Units (Census Tracts) and MAPC 2012-2016 Aggregate Rent by Units (Census Tracts) was downloaded from DataCommons (https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/21).  I converted the csvs to excel and then used a VLOOKUP function to connect the Opportunity Zone to the median rent per census tract in each of the time periods.  We then calculated the percentage increase in rent per census tract by dividing the increase in rent by the rent in the earlier timeperiod.  The MA average was calculated by taking the average of all MA census tracts in both periods.
