We built all of our data sets by starting with a list of all the designated Opportunity Zones in the United States.  The data was accessed from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund website (www.cdifund.gov/Pages/Opportunity-Zones.aspx).  We then filtered the file to isolate Opportunity Zones in Massachusetts and mapped the provided Census Tracts with another file that contained Zip Codes for all Census Tracts.  The Census Tract to Zip Code file was downloaded from HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research website (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/usps_crosswalk.html).
