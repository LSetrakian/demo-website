The dataset MAPC 2012-2016 Household Tenure by Age (Census Tracts) was downloaded from DataCommons (https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/134).  I converted the CSV file to excel and then used a VLOOKUP function to connect the Opportunity Zone to the total number of households and number of renters per census tract.  We then calculated the percentage of renters per census tract by dividing the number of renters by the total number of households.  The MA average was calculated by dividing the total number of renters in all the MA census tracts and dividing by the total number of households in all MA census tracts.
