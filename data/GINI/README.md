The dataset MAPC 2012-2016 Gini Index (Census Tracts) was downloaded from DataCommons
(https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/153). I converted the CSV file to excel and then used a VLOOKUP function to
connect the Gini Index to each Opportunity Zone. I removed two Opportunity Zones where the Index was zero.
I found the total MA average from the following website which was used to compare to each of the 136 Opportunity Zones:
