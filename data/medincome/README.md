In order to get the median income per census tract, the dataset MAPC 2012-2016 Median Household Income by Race (Census Tracts) was downloaded from DataCommons (https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/117).  
I converted the CSV file to excel and then used a VLOOKUP function to connect the census tract to desiginated Opportunity Zone Census Tracts (from our original data conversion, see overall README).
Median Income by census tract was grabbed directly from the Median Household Income by Race Dataset.
