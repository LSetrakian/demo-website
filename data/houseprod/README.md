In order to get number of households per community, the dataset MAPC 2011-2015 Household Type by Household Income (Municipality) was downloaded from DataCommons (https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/334).  
In order to get the housing starts per community in 2017, the dataset MAPC 2017 Building Permits by Type and Year (Municipal) was downloaded from DataCommons (https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/384). 
I converted the CSV file to excel and then used a VLOOKUP function to connect the municipality to desiginated Opportunity Zone Cities (from our original data conversion, see overall README)
Households per community were grabbed directly from the Household type dataset
Housing Starts were calculated by summing data of household permits for single and mult-family homes.
