In order to get the median income per census tract for 2016, the dataset MAPC 2012-2016 Median Household Income by Race (Census Tracts) was downloaded from DataCommons (https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/117).  
In order to get the median income per census tract for 2012, the dataset MAPC 2008-2012 Median Household Income by Race (Census Tracts) was downloaded from DataCommons (https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/117) by switching the year to 2008-2012.
I converted the CSV file to excel and then used a VLOOKUP function to connect the census tract to desiginated Opportunity Zone Census Tracts (from our original data conversion, see overall README).
Median Income by census tract was grabbed directly from the Median Household Income by Race Dataset for 2008 and 2016
I then created a new variable calculating the percent change from 2008-2016 per each census tract.
