<h2>Overview of Program </h2>

<p>The Opportunity Zone Program was created as part of the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 to incentivize investment in low income communities. State governors can nominate up to 25% of their state’s low income census tracts to be deemed Opportunity Zones. Capital gains from investment in economic activities in Opportunity Zones are given favorable tax treatment through the program. The program presents an opportunity for both Opportunity Zone residents and private investors to benefit from these incentivized private investments. </p>

<p>In Massachusetts, the U.S. Treasury has designated 138 census tracts in 79 communities as Opportunity Zones. The map below displays the 138 Opportunity Zones in Massachusetts.</p>

<h2>Considerations of Opportunity Zones</h2>

<p>Opportunity zones can be a powerful tool to attract investment into often overlooked communities.  However, national and local critics question the certification of particular opportunity zones in areas with higher incomes, growing economies, and thriving real estate markets.  While many communities such as Fall River, Springfield, and New Bedford coudl benefit from additional economic incentives, other areas like tourist-heavy Provincetown and dynamic Somerville are already experiencing economic booms.  As such, both policymakers and investors should be aware of the large variation across designated opportunity zones.  Some may be less risky and already rapidly developing, while others may be more risky and in greater need of investment.  Responsible policy and investment requires being aware of these dynamics.</p>

Housing starts indicate whether a community is already experiencing a building boom.</p>
