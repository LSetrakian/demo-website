<h1>Massachusetts Opportunity Zones</h1>

<h2>Overview of Opportunity Zones Program </h2>

<!--Note: need to rework this text, it came directly from a website-->
<p>The U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 created the Opportunity Zone Program to provide incentives for investment in low income communities throughout the country. An Opportunity Zone is a designated geographic area, in which individuals can gain favorable tax treatment on their capital gains, by investing those funds (through a privately-created Opportunity Fund) into economic activities in the area. </p>

<h2>Opportunity Zones in Massachusetts</h2>

<p>The U.S. Treasury has designated 138 tracts in 79 Massachusetts communities as Opportunity Zones. The Opportunity Zone program presents an opportunity for private, tax-advantaged investment into areas of economic need, benefiting both residents living in the zones and private investors. Governor Charlie Baker announced the designations on May 18, 2018.</p>

<h2>Criticism of Opportunity Zones</h2>

<p>Some of the Massachusetts opportunity zones certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury have left locals scratching their heads over why an incentive is needed to build. While low-income parts of Fall River, Springfield and New Bedford made the cut, so did neighborhoods in places like the tourist-heavy Provincetown as well as Alewife in West Cambridge, which developers are already building up as a life science relief valve to Kendall Square.</p>
