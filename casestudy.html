	<h2>Comparison of two Opportunity Zones</h2>
	<p>While Opportunity Zones are meant to target communities that have historically seen limited investment, there is substantial variation across Massachusetts Opportunity Zones.  These variations extend across demographics, income, and housing indicators, leading to a diverse set of communities.  As an investor, this poses challenging incentives, where there may be certain communities that have higher income and therefore may be more attractive from a risk and revenue perspective.  Converseley, there are some communities that perform worse on economic indicators and therefore despite demonstrating a greater need for investment, may be viewed less favorably from an investing perspective.</p>
	<p>Below we have detailed two different communities that have been designated as Opportunity Zones.</p>
