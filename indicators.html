	<h2>Income Inequality (Gini Coefficient)</h2>
	<p>The Gini Coefficient is a measure of inequality. The Coefficient is measured by comparing perfect income distribution with the income distribution in a given area. The closer the coefficient to zero, the lower the level of inequality in a given census tract.</p>
	<p>The table below displays the Gini Coefficient of 136* Opportunity Zones in Massachusetts. Only 36 are above the state-wide average of 0.484, indicating lower-than-average inequality.</p>

	<p>The table below displays the change in Gini Coefficient of a given Opportunity Zone in Massachusetts from 2008-2012 to 2012-2016. A positive change indicates that the Gini Coefficient increased which shows that the measure of inequality increased over time. The Gini Coefficient increased for 87 Opportunity Zones.</p>
