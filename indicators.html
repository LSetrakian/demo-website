	<h2>Median Income</h2>
	<p>A handful of communities in opportunity zone tracks seem do be doing well. They are not traditionally though of as needing investment and revitalization as they are all above $60,000 in median income. Is there a risk of investment dollars flowing to communities already doing pretty well? </p>

	<h2>Median Income Change</h2>
	<p>Over half of MA opportunity zone census tract designations sae positive income growth in the last 8 years. This demonstrates a lack of focus on the most distressed communities. There is a risk that investors will focus on these growing communities accelerating gentrification and ignoring those with negative growth that need the most help.</p>
