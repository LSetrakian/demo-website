	<h1>Economic Indicators in Massachusetts Opportunity Zones</h1>
	<h2>Median Income</h2>
	<p>A handful of communities in opportunity zone tracks seem do be doing well. They are not traditionally though of as needing investment and revitalization as they are all above $60,000 in median income. Is there a risk of investment dollars flowing to communities already doing pretty well? </p>

	<h2>Median Income Change</h2>
	<p>Over half of MA opportunity zone census tract designations sae positive income growth in the last 8 years. This demonstrates a lack of focus on the most distressed communities. There is a risk that investors will focus on these growing communities accelerating gentrification and ignoring those with negative growth that need the most help.</p>

  <h2>Income Inequality (Gini Coefficient)</h2>
	<p>The Gini Coefficient is a measure of inequality. The Coefficient is measured by comparing perfect income distribution with the income distribution in a given area. The closer the coefficient to zero, the lower the level of inequality in a given census tract.</p>
	<p>The table below displays the Gini Coefficient of 136* Opportunity Zones in Massachusetts. Only 36 are above the state-wide average of 0.484, indicating lower-than-average inequality.</p>

	<p>The table below displays the change in Gini Coefficient of a given Opportunity Zone in Massachusetts from 2008-2012 to 2012-2016. A positive change indicates that the Gini Coefficient increased which shows that the measure of inequality increased over time. The Gini Coefficient increased for 87 Opportunity Zones.</p>
