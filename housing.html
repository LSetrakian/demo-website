	<h1>Housing in Massachusetts Opportunity Zones</h1>
	<h2>Percentage of Renters</h2>
	<p>Most opportunity zones have a high percentage of renters.</p>

	<h2>Housing Starts</h2>
	<p>Most housing production is clustered around a comparable household size per community, but a handful of municipalities have hot housing markets building more than their weight. There is a risk that opportunity zones accelerate these trends. There are also some cities like Worcester not building enough, so perhaps the designation will help encourage production.</p>
