	<h1>Housing in Massachusetts Opportunity Zones</h1>
	<h2>Renter Dominated Markets</h2>
	<p>Designated Opportunity Zones in Massachusetts tend to be renter dominated markets, with rental rates as high as 100%.  In most cases, the zones have a higher percentage of renters than the Massachusetts average.</p>

    <h2>Opportunity Zone's high rental rates put residents at risk of displacement</h2>

	 <p>The high rate of renters in these markets poses several challenges:  Improvements to housing stock and increased property values may not translate in increased household wealth.  Residents may be sensitive to price increases and could be priced-out of the market through new developments.  Current residents may be unlikely to purchase newly developed housing.</p>
	

	 <h2>Increasing Rents</h2>
	   <p>While Massachusetts Opportunity Zones are primarily dominated by renters, rental prices have been increasing in most of the zones.  While the average rate of increase is not out of line with the Massachusetts average, rates have increased substantially in several markets.  Rents have increased more than 40% in Lowell, Fall River, and Somerset, MA.</p>
	 <h2>Rents have increased as much as 20-40% in some Opportunity Zones</h2>

	<h2>Housing Starts</h2>
	<p>Housing production is a contentious issue in Massachusetts given its connection to competing gentrification and affordability concerns. Most housing production in MA opportunity zones is clustered around a comparable total number of households per community, but a handful of municipalities have hot housing markets building more than their weight. There is a risk that opportunity zones accelerate these trends. There are also some cities like Worcester not building enough housing, so perhaps the designation will help encourage production.</p>
